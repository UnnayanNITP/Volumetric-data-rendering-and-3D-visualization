### **System Requirement**
CPU::An average CPU needed are optimal.A 4.0 GHz base is ideal.
GPU::A GPU is a graphics processing unit, and as the name suggests, it bears some resemblance to a CPU, responsible for processing certain computations, GPUs are vital for 3D rendering. NVIDIA GTX 1060 or higher will be sufficient for many applications.
RAM:: For some 3D rendering jobs, 8 GB of RAM will get the job done, but to be fully optimized, 32 GB is recommended.
Graphics card memory::6GB or more.

###  **Code overview**
1.Dataset reading.
2.Filter.
3.Mapper.
4.Actor.
5.Create renderer to render the window.
6.Calling the transfer function.
7.Create window interactor to interact.

### **How to run the given code.**
1. install different packages used in the code.
2. Create python enviroment to run by install jupyter notebook 
In case find diffulties try to visit this link [Jupyterintall](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
3. Store the mecanix.raw, ipyTransferFunction.py, minor_projectcode.ipynb and mecanix.txt dataset and files in Folder.
4. Open the minor_projectcode.ipynb and set the dataset path.
5. Run it.
6. Volume is rendered.
7. Incase different dataset it is required then change dataset path and name.
8. In function SetdataExtend change parameter according to dimension given of the dataset.
9. Repeat the step 2,3 and 4.
